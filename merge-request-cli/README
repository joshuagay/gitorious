Gitorious CLI
==========

Provide a CLI interface to merge requests in your Gitorious
repository: list merge requests, open them in a browser etc.

Installation
----------

The git-merge-requests script should be put into a directory in your
PATH, after which you may use is as a Git command.


Requirements
----------

The tool is written in Ruby, and requires the following libraries:

* rubygems
* nokogiri

Operations
----------

* git merge-requests list [STATUS]: list all merge requests with given status (default "Open")
* git merge-requests show ID: Open the specified merge request in a browser
* git merge-requests checkout ID: Check out the specified merge
  request into a new branch (merge-requests/ID). This branch will
  start on the first commit in the merge request and end on the last
  commit in the merge request.
* git merge-requests diff ID: Will checkout the specified merge
  request if that has not been done, and then display the diff in that
  merge request

Issues/TODO
----------

Lots! 

* A non-documented issue is that we assume the Git remote on Gitorious
  is named "origin".
* We should have a merge command (which merges and resolves)
* Tab completion
* Complete merge request statuses from project page on Gitorious
* Determine if the merge request applies cleanly to the branch it's
  proposed merged into

Contributing
----------

Clone the repository, submit a merge request (!)
