    Gitorious provides open source infrastructure for hosting open source
    projects that use Git. The central entity in Gitorious is the project, which
    contains one or more top-level repositories and any repositories managed by
    the project's contributors. This allows you, as a project administrator, to
    keep an eye on what people are working on in their individual clones of your
    repositories. It also lets you merge or provide feedback on their
    contributions. Likewise, as a project contributor, you get a place to host
    your contributions and provide feedback back into the projects ecosystem and
    easily collaborate with others on the same project. You get your own
    personal clone of the project on the site that you can work freely in and a
    way to package up your changes and notify the other project members about
    your changes.

      <h3>History</h3>
      <p>
    Gitorious was started by Johan Sørensen in the end of 2007 as a way to
    easily host Git repositories for himself. The idea turned out to be so
    useful that Gitorious began to offer hosting for other projects as well, for
    free, eventually opening up for anyone to create an account.
      </p>
      <p>
    In March 2009 Gitorious.org was folded into <a
    href="http://shortcut.no">Shortcut AS</a>, a software company co-founded by
    Johan. The intention was to improve Gitorious beyond what was feasible for a
    single developer to manage. <a href="http://gitorious.com">Gitorious AS</a>
    now officially supports and develops Gitorious in cooperation with
    contributors outside the company, while still being 100% free software.

    Public License</a>.
