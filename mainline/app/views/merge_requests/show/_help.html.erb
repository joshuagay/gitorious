      <h4>How to update the merge request?</h4>
      <p>
        To update your merge request, either <%= link_to("edit here", :action =>
                                                   :edit) %> or push your changes through git. A new version of your merge
        request will be created, up until the last commit you push. You may make as
        many updates as you like; the last one will always be displayed by default
      </p>
      <pre><%= "git push #{merge_request.target_repository.push_url} #{merge_request.source_branch}:#{merge_request.ref_name}" -%></pre>
      <h4>How to merge these changes?</h4>
      <p>
        Pull the changes into a local branch for review, verify the changes (run
        tests etc) and then merge into master:
      </p>
      <pre># Check out a new branch for integration
git checkout -b merge-requests/<%= merge_request.sequence_number %>

# Fetch the merge request into this branch
git pull <%= merge_request.target_repository.default_clone_url %> <%= merge_request.ref_name %>

# Review commits
git log --pretty=oneline --abbrev-commit <%= merge_request.target_branch %>..merge-requests/<%= merge_request.sequence_number %>

# Apply the changes to your branch:
git checkout <%= merge_request.target_branch %>
git merge merge-requests/<%= merge_request.sequence_number %>
git push origin <%= merge_request.target_branch %></pre>
