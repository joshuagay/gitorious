      <p>
        We're sorry, but it seems that the server timed out trying to fetch the
        diffs for your merge request. This typically means that the merge request
        is large. Please review changes locally:
      </p>
      <pre># Create a local branch
git checkout -b merge-requests/<%= merge_request.sequence_number %>

# Fetch the merge request into the new branch
git pull <%= merge_request.target_repository.clone_url %> <%= merge_request.ref_name %>

# Show the commits
git log --pretty=oneline --abbrev-commit <%= merge_request.target_branch %>..merge-requests/<%= merge_request.sequence_number %></pre>
      <p>
        If you believe that this merge request is indeed not too big for the web
        interface, please
        contact <a href="mailto:<%= Gitorious.support_email %>"><%= Gitorious.support_email %></a>.
