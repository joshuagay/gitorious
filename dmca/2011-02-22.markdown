**Re: Notification of United States Copyright Law Violations at Listed URLs**

Dear Mr. Mathiesen:

Thank you for your email of February 3, 2011. Sony Computer
Entertainment America LLC ("SCEA") appreciates Gitorious’s prompt
compliance with SCEA’s prior takedown request and removal of the
repositories at the addresses referenced in our February 1, 2011
letter (the "Feb. 1, 2011 URLs"). As you have requested, the following
shall explain how the content at the Feb. 1, 2011 URLs is unlawful
under Norwegian law.

The Norwegian Copyright Act contains prohibitions against the
circumvention of effective technological protection
measures. Specifically, section 53a of the Copyright Act prohibits the
"circumvent[ion of] effective technological protection measures that
the right holder, or others he has given permission, employs to
control the copying or making available to the public of a protected
work." The files hosted at the Listed URLs are circumvention devices
that violate this statutory provision because they circumvent
technological protection measures in SCEA’s PlayStation® 3 computer
entertainment system that protect copyrighted works, including SCEA
copyrighted software programs, Programmer Tools, and video
games. Thus, the content at the Listed URLs is in violation of
Norwegian law as circumvention devices in violation of section 53a
Norwegian Copyright Act.

Gitorious’s hosting of the content at the Listed URLs subjects it to
direct liability under the Norwegian Copyright Act. Specifically, it
is unlawful under section 53a to: "a) sell, rent or in any other way
make available, b) manufacture or import for the making available to
the public, c) advertise for sale or rental, d) possess for commercial
purposes, or e) offer services in connection with" the aforementioned
circumvention devices. Similarly, under section 53c, "[t]he sale of,
or possession for purposes of gain, of any means the sole purpose of
which is to facilitate the unlawful removal or circumvention of
technical devices for the protection of a computer program, is
prohibited."

We note that Gitorious’s hosting of the content at the Listed URLs, or
any similar content constitutes multiple violations of the
abovementioned provisions of the Norwegian Copyright Act, including
but not limited to "mak[ing] available," "import[ing] for the making
available to the public," "possess[ing] for commercial purposes,"
and/or "possession for purposes of gain."

Furthermore, Gitorious’s hosting activities give rise to liability for
contributory copyright infringement under the Norwegian Copyright Act
sections 2 and 54. Specifically, the content at the Listed URLs
facilitate infringement of copyrighted works, as discussed above. By
hosting the content at the Listed URLs, Gitorious is thereby making
the files more accessible to the public, and consequently,
facilitating copyright infringement of protected works. *See* the
Norwegian Supreme Court’s napster.no case (Rt. 2005 s. 41) (holding
owner of the website www.napster.no was liable for contributory
infringement).

In the time that has passed since your last correspondence, we have
identified similar content at additional URLs hosted by Gitorious (the
"Feb. 16, 2011 URLs"). Please refer to the table below identifying the

Specifically, the content at the Listed URLs markets, traffics in,
distributes, and offers "Custom Firmware," "Keys," and/or "Signing
Tools" files or components thereof. These files or components thereof
are illegal because they facilitate infringement of copyrighted works,
including SCEA copyrighted software programs, Programmer Tools, and
video games, in violation of the Norwegian Copyright Act sections 2
and 54, and the United States Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. § 101, *et
seq*. and 17 U.S.C. § 501, *et seq*. The files also constitute
circumvention programs, technologies, devices, services, or components
because they circumvent SCEA’s PlayStation®3 computer entertainment
system’s technological protection measures in violation of the
Norwegian Copyright Act section 53 and the United States Digital
Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA"), 17 U.S.C. § 1201, *et seq*.

I have a good faith basis that the web content at the Listed URLs is
an infringement of SCEA’s rights under Norwegian and United States
copyright law, and that the infringing content is authorized by
neither SCEA nor the law.

**Accordingly, SCEA requests that you immediately take down the web
content at all of the URLs listed above. Please remove the content as
soon as possible, and no later than by February 23, 2011.** Thank you
in advance for your continued cooperation and assistance. If you have
any questions, please contact me at the email address or phone number
listed above.


Sincerely,
KILPATRICK TOWNSEND & STOCKTON LLP
