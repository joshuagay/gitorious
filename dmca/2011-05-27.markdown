The code posted on gitorious at
https://gitorious.org/eveonline/eveonline is the decompiled source
code for our product EVE Online. We ask that you remove the infringing
materials as soon as possible. I may be contacted at sean@ccpgames.com
with any questions.

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials
described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the
copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this
notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am
authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that
is allegedly infringed
