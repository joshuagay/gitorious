* Gitoriousd â€“ the Gitorious daemon
   - Main executable in /usr/sbin/gitorious
     Responds to normal start, stop, status, restart, reload
   - Pids in /var/run/gitorious/$service.pid
   - Executables in /usr/libexec/gitorious/$service. All executable files in here will be run
   - /etc/gitorious.conf contains (at least) GITORIOUS_ROOT

   Each process should respond to {start,stop,status,restart,reload} and emit
   relevant exit codes

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
gitorious start: Starts all (non-running) processes from libexec
gitorious stop: Sends SIGQUIT to all running processes
gitorious restart: stop && restart
gitorious reload: Sends SIGHUP to all processes, which will cause them to reload config
[gitorious logrotate: Sends SIGUSR1 to all processes, which will cause them to reopen log files]
#+END_EXAMPLE
** Which daemons?
*** TODO git-daemons
*** TODO git-proxy
*** TODO unicorn
*** DONE searchd
*** DONE resque-worker
** Main scenarios
*** System startup: start all associated daemons
    - [ ] Start all tasks
    - [ ] Ignore running tasks (ie don't restart any tasks)
*** System shutdown: stop all associated daemons
    - [ ] Stop all tasks
    - [ ] Ignore ones that aren't running (ie. don't complain)
*** Check status
    - [ ] UP or DOWN
*** Log rotation
    - [ ] "Reload" all running tasks
    - [ ] Ignore ones that aren't running (ie. don't start any tasks)
*** Restart (after code updates etc)
    - [ ] Restart all tasks
    - [ ] Start the ones that aren't running
